    <strong>Sibling Similarity in Adolescent Risky Behaviors</strong><br>
    <em>Job Market Paper. Draft coming soon!</em>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
    Despite well-documented sibling similarity in risky behaviors, little is known about the mechanisms that drive it. This paper provides the first empirical evidence from South Korea that this similarity cannot be fully explained by parental socioeconomic status or direct sibling spillovers, and that unobserved common factors, such as parenting style and household norms, also play an essential role in shaping it. Using four complementary identification strategies, I find that socioeconomic background accounts for part of the observed correlation but can sometimes suppress the mechanisms that generate it. The influence of older siblings is modest, largely contemporaneous, and can discourage rather than imitate certain behaviors. A substantial portion instead reflects these unobserved common factors, notably, 67 percent for drinking and 86 percent for violence, which are more readily shaped by parental conduct and household norms. These effects are most pronounced among brother pairs and siblings close in age. This finding underscores that sibling similarity in risky behaviors is structured less by peer imitation than by family norms and intra-household dynamics.

    <strong>Birth Order and Parental Investments in South Korea</strong><br>
    <em>Working Paper — Preparing for submission to <u>Review of Economics of the Household</u></em><br>
    Presented at MEA 2025, PAA 2025, WEAI 2025, and SOLE 2025

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
    The mechanisms underlying the impact of birth order on parental inputs and child outcomes are still unclear. This study considers that pregnancy planning, gender preference, and expectations can vary with birth order, affecting parental inputs. Using this perspective, I investigate the influence of birth order on parental inputs and children’s time use in South Korea. Apart from parental supervision, I find that parents are more involved in school activities and invest more in private education expenditures for first-born children than their later-born siblings. These results indirectly affect children’s time use, so that firstborn children spend more time in private education and less time in leisure activities than their siblings. Another key finding is that there is no gender effect in parental inputs, which provides evidence that the historically strong preference for sons in South Korea has considerably declined in recent years. These results support existing research on long-term outcomes associated with birth order and contribute to understanding parental investment behavior. The evidence consistently points to parents investing more in their firstborns in South Korea. This firstborn advantage has also existed in the country’s past, but the findings suggest that it may have intensified under sustained low fertility. As family size decreases, parents increasingly concentrate their limited resources on the eldest child to maximize educational and economic returns and enhance the household’s overall prospects.

    <strong>The Influence of Household Income on Children’s Outcomes in Korea</strong><br>
    <em>Preliminary draft; based on Master’s Thesis (2018)</em><br>
    Available at: <a href="http://www.riss.kr/link?id=T14874083" target="_blank">http://www.riss.kr/link?id=T14874083</a>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
    This ongoing project investigates how variations in household income affect children’s education and long-term outcomes in South Korea. Using national panel data and instrumental variable strategies, the study seeks to isolate the causal impact of income shocks on child development, with a focus on intergenerational inequality.
