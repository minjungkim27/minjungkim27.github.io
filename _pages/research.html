## Working Papers

1. **Sibling Similarity in Adolescent Risky Behaviors**  
   *Job Market Paper. Draft coming soon!*  

   <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
   This paper explores how sibling dynamics influence adolescent risk-taking behavior using panel data of Korean youth. We find that siblings exhibit significant similarities in smoking, drinking, and delinquent behaviors, even after controlling for family fixed effects. Results suggest intra-family spillovers and shared environmental effects are central to youth behavior formation.

2. **Birth Order and Parental Investments in South Korea**  
   *Working Paper — Preparing for submission to* _Review of Economics of the Household_  
   Presented at PAA 2025, WEAI 2025, and SOLE 2025  

   <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
   This study examines how birth order shapes parental time and monetary investments in children using household panel data. Employing a sibling fixed-effects model, we show that firstborns receive significantly more resources in early childhood, with effects persisting into adolescence. The findings highlight long-term educational and labor market implications of within-family resource allocation.

   Available at: [http://www.riss.kr/link?id=T14874083](http://www.riss.kr/link?id=T14874083)

   <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
   This ongoing project investigates how variations in household income affect children’s education and long-term outcomes in South Korea. Using national panel data and instrumental variable strategies, the study seeks to isolate the causal impact of income shocks on child development, with a focus on intergenerational inequality.
