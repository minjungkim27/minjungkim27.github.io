Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa.

My research lies in applied microeconomics, with a particular focus on labor, health, and education economics. 

I analyze how family structure and intra-household dynamics influence individual outcomes over the life cycle, with an emphasis on early-life environments and their effects on long-term health and educational outcomes.

I will be on the 2025-26 academic job market.
